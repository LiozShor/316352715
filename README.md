# LoveStory Duvik Page

This project is a personal and creative website built as part of a course assignment. The goal was to create a complete static website using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Project Overview

The website introduces Duvik Rosen, a 67-year-old widower from Herzliya who is a mentor to young entrepreneurs, a volunteer at a dog rescue organization, and a blogger who writes about new beginnings and late-life love.
